      I'm an experienced Web Developer currently working for an award winning software development
      agency, I'm involved in the development of custom
      <a class="font-medium" href="https://wordpress.org" rel="noopener">WordPress</a>
      themes and <a class="font-medium" href="https://laravel.com" rel="noopener">Laravel</a>
      systems using
      <a class="font-medium" href="https://filamentphp.com" rel="noopener">Filament</a>. I leverage
      my expertise in JavaScript using technologies like
      <a class="font-medium" href="https://react.dev" rel="noopener">React</a>
      and <a class="font-medium" href="https://nextjs.org" rel="noopener">Next.js</a> in my personal

      Outside of my professional role, I enjoy exploring new programming languages, tools, and
      emerging tech. Take a look at my <a class="font-medium" href="/projects">projects</a> and contributions

      Aside from my passion for web and software, I go to the gym, watch combat sports - especially
      Boxing and MMA. I disconnect from the digital world by going on walks and reading books.
      Currently, I'm reading Deep Work by Cal Newport.
