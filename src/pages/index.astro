      I'm an experienced Web Developer currently working for an award winning software development
      agency, involved in the development of custom <strong>WordPress</strong>
      themes and <strong>Laravel</strong> systems using <strong>Filament</strong>. I leverage my
      expertise in JavaScript using technologies like <strong>React</strong> and
      <strong>Next.js</strong> in my personal projects. Recently I've also been playing around with
      <strong>Go</strong>.
    </p>

      Outside of my professional role, I enjoy exploring new programming languages, tools, and
      emerging tech. Take a look at my <Link href="/projects">projects</Link> and contributions on <Link
        href="https://github.com/mohammedyh"
        external>GitHub</Link
      >.
    </p>

      Aside from my passion for web and software development, I go to the gym and watch combat
      sports, especially boxing and MMA. I disconnect by taking walks and reading books. Currently,
      I'm reading "Deep Work" by Cal Newport.
